# Question
Just 24 hours back on Monday (23 September 2024) I got the email from the hiring team regarding the following assesments with the question as follows.

Thank you for your interest in the Engineering position at Illumio. As part of our interview process, we would like to assess your technical skills through a take-home coding exercise. 

Please find the details of the exercise below. We ask that you complete the exercise within 48-72 hours, upload it to a GitHub project and share the project link with us. If you need more time, please tell me so I can update the hiring team. This assessment shouldnâ€™t take longer than 2(ish) hours. Feel free to write the code in whatever environment you prefer.  

Description 

Write a program that can parse a file containing flow log data and maps each row to a tag based on a lookup table. The lookup table is defined as a csv file, and it has 3 columns, dstport,protocol,tag.   The dstport and protocol combination decide what tag can be applied.   

Sample flow logs (default logs, version 2 only).

For e.g.  the lookup table file can be something like: 

dstport,protocol,tag 

25,tcp,sv_P1 

68,udp,sv_P2 

23,tcp,sv_P1 

31,udp,SV_P3 

443,tcp,sv_P2 

22,tcp,sv_P4 

3389,tcp,sv_P5 

0,icmp,sv_P5 

110,tcp,email 

993,tcp,email 

143,tcp,email 

 

The program should generate an output file containing the following: 

Count of matches for each tag, sample o/p shown below 
 

Tag Counts: 

Tag,Count 

sv_P2,1 

sv_P1,2 

sv_P4,1 

email,3 

Untagged,9          

Count of matches for each port/protocol combination 
Port/Protocol Combination Counts: 

 Port,Protocol,Count 

22,tcp,1 

23,tcp,1 

25,tcp,1 

110,tcp,1 

143,tcp,1 

443,tcp,1 

993,tcp,1 

1024,tcp,1 

49158,tcp,1 

80,tcp,1 

 
Requirement details 

Input file as well as the file containing tag mappings are plain text (ascii) files  
The flow log file size can be up to 10 MB 
The lookup file can have up to 10000 mappings 
The tags can map to more than one port, protocol combinations.  for e.g. sv_P1 and sv_P2 in the sample above. 
The matches should be case insensitive 
 

For anything else that is not clear, please make reasonable assumptions and document those in the Readme to be sent with your submission.   

Reference for flow logs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html  

Submissions 

Please upload the submission to any of the collaboration portals like GitHub that you are comfortable sharing and share the link with us.   The submission should come with a readme with info on all the assumptions made, for instance, the program only supports default log format, not custom and the only version that is supported is 2. 

Also, please include instructions on how to compile/run the program, what tests were done, and any other analysis you may want to share about your code/program.  

Please avoid using non-default libraries or packages like Hadoop, spark, pandas etc. The idea is to be able to review and run the program on a local machine without needing to install too many dependencies / packages.  

 

Thanks and best of luck!

# Assumption

The following are the assumptions that I made, while writing the code for this assessment.

1. Here, my assumption is that for version 2 of flow-log records is that for getting the dstport and protocol number -> its there at 7th and 8th position (for 0th order indexing its on 6th and 7th position as per this link -> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html) in the whole log file on each and every line.
2. (THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION) -> the look
